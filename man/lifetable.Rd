\title{Construct lifetables from mortality rates}
\usage{
lifetable(data, series = names(data$rate)[1], years = data$year,
  ages = data$age, max.age = min(100, max(data$age)),
  type = c("period", "cohort"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Demogdata object such as obtained from \code{\link{read.demogdata}}, 
\code{\link{forecast.fdm}} or \code{\link{forecast.lca}}.}

\item{series}{Name of series to use.  Default is the first series in data\$rate.}

\item{years}{Vector indicating which years to include in the tables.}

\item{ages}{Vector indicating which ages to include in table.}

\item{max.age}{Age for last row. Ages beyond this are combined.}

\item{type}{Type of lifetable: \code{period} or \code{cohort}.}
}
\value{
Object of class \dQuote{lifetable} containing the following components:
\item{label}{Name of region from which data are taken.}
\item{series}{Name of series}
\item{age}{Ages for lifetable}
\item{year}{Period years or cohort years}
\item{mx}{Death rate at age x.}
\item{qx}{The probability that an individual of exact age x will die before exact age x+1.}
\item{lx}{Number of survivors to exact age x.  The radix is 1.}
\item{dx}{The number of deaths between exact ages x and x+1.}
\item{Lx}{Number of years lived between exact age x and exact age x+1.}
\item{Tx}{Number of years lived after exact age x.}
\item{ex}{Remaining life expectancy at exact age x.}
Note that the lifetables themselves are not returned, only their components. However, there is a print method that constructs (and returns)
the lifetables from the above components.

\description{
Computes period and cohort lifetables from mortality rates for multiple years.
}
\details{
For period lifetables, all years and all ages specified are included in the tables. For cohort lifetables, 
if \code{ages} takes a scalar value, then the cohorts are taken to be of that age in each year contained in \code{years}. 
But if \code{ages} is a vector of values, then the cohorts are taken to be of those ages in the first year contained in \code{years}.

For example, if \code{ages=0} then lifetables of the birth cohorts for all years in \code{years} are computed. On the other hand, 
if \code{ages=0:100} and \code{years=1950:2010}, then lifetables of each age cohort in 1950 are computed.

In all cases, \eqn{q_x = m_x/(1+[(1-a_x)m_x])}{qx = mx/(1 + ((1-ax) * mx))} as per Chiang (1984).

Warning: the code has only been tested for data based on single-year age groups.
